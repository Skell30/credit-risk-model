ðŸ“Œ What is Credit Risk?
Credit risk is the chance that a borrower wonâ€™t meet their obligations (e.g., fail to repay a loan) and the lender will suffer a financial loss. Key components include:
â€¢	Probability of Default (PD) â€“ the likelihood a borrower will default.
â€¢	Loss Given Default (LGD) â€“ the portion of exposure not recovered after default.
â€¢	Exposure at Default (EAD) â€“ total value the bank is exposed to when a borrower defaults.
â€¢	Expected Loss (EL) = PD Ã— LGD Ã— EAD â€“ this is the average anticipated loss over time.
Banks manage credit risk through credit scoring, risk ratings, loan diversification, credit limits, collateral, monitoring, and provisioning.
Basel IIâ€™s Role in Credit Risk
Established in 2004 and widely implemented by 2008, Basel II is the second set of international banking capital regulations investopedia.com+15investopedia.com+15fe.training+15. Its aim: make capital requirements more sensitive to riskâ€”especially credit risk.
It operates on three pillars 
Pillar 1: Minimum Capital Requirements
â€¢	Banks must hold capital equal to at least 8% of risk-weighted assets (RWA) 
â€¢	RWA reflects the credit quality of loans and other exposures.
â€¢	For credit risk, Basel II introduces three methods banks can use to calculate RWA:
1.	Standardized Approach â€“ banks rely on external credit ratings.
2.	Foundation IRB â€“ banks use internal ratings for PD but regulatory LGD/EAD.
3.	Advanced IRB â€“ banks estimate PD, LGD, and EAD internally 
â€¢	Advanced methods better align capital with actual risk and can reduce capital burdens 
Pillar 2: Supervisory Review
â€¢	Regulators review a bankâ€™s internal risk management system (e.g., ICAAP â€“ Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process).
â€¢	They can require banks to hold extra capital for risks not fully captured under Pillar 1, like concentration or liquidity risks.
Pillar 3: Market Discipline
â€¢	Banks must disclose risk exposures, capital adequacy, and modeling methods.
â€¢	This transparency promotes market scrutiny and encourages sound risk management .

Practical Impacts & Tools
â€¢	Under the Standardized Approach, reliance on external agencies (Moodyâ€™s, S&P, Fitch) influences capital requirementsâ€”and choice of agency can create 6â€“10% variation in capital needed.
â€¢	Advanced IRB requires rigorous internal modeling of credit metrics and is subject to strong supervisory oversight .
â€¢	Techniques like Synthetic Risk Transfer (SRT)â€”e.g., securitizationâ€”let banks shift credit risk off their balance sheets, reducing capital needs, though this introduces other systemic and counterparty risks.

Summary
â€¢	Credit risk is central to banking, quantified via PD, LGD, EAD -> EL.
â€¢	Basel II institutionalized more risk-sensitive capital requirements for credit (Pillar 1), stronger supervisory oversight (Pillar 2), and greater transparency (Pillar 3).
â€¢	Banks using advanced internal models can lower capital buffers if models meet regulatory standards.
â€¢	Use of external ratings and risk transfers adds complexityâ€”leading to both efficiencies and potential new risks.
